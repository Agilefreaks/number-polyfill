= Number polyfill

This is a polyfill for implementing the HTML5 `<input type="number">` element in browsers that do not currently support it.

== Usage

Using it is easy â€” simply include the `number-polyfill.js` file in the HEAD of the HTML page. You can then use `<input type="number">` elements normally.

If the script detects that the browser doesn't support `<input type="number">`, it will search for these elements and attach some Javascript to them to make them function as number-only input fields, and add increment/decrement buttons.

A default CSS file is provided. You may edit this file to style the buttons to make them look the way you want.

== Dependencies

This script requires jQuery[http://jquery.com/].
